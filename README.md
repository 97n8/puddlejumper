# 🦆 PuddleJumper

**Your Shortcut to the Clouds**

PuddleJumper is a multi-tenant governance engine for municipal decision workflows, part of the [PublicLogic](https://publiclogic.org) ecosystem.

## Repository Structure

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `n8drive/` | Core PuddleJumper application (TypeScript, Express, pnpm monorepo) |
| `publiclogic-operating-system/` | PublicLogic OS playbooks (canonical source) |
| `publiclogic-os-ui/` | PublicLogic OS frontend (static vanilla JS app, canonical HMLP source) |
| `publiclogic-site/` | Marketing/public site (includes HMLP, a mirror of OS UI) |
| `scripts/` | Sync utilities and helper scripts |
| `tests/` | E2E tests (Playwright) |
| `_archived/` | Retired projects preserved for reference (see `_archived/README.md`) |

## Getting Started

```bash
cd n8drive
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

## Playbook Sync

Three directories hold playbook content and must stay in sync:
- `publiclogic-operating-system/` — canonical source
- `publiclogic-os-ui/content/playbooks/` — UI copy
- `publiclogic-site/HMLP/content/playbooks/` — site copy

```bash
./scripts/sync-playbooks.sh          # sync all copies from canonical source
./scripts/sync-playbooks.sh --check  # check for drift (CI-friendly, exits 1 if out of sync)
```
