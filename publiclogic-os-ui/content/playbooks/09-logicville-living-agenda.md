# Logicville, MA — Living Agenda (PublicLogic™)

A clean, modern operating system for two founders. Mobile‑first. Action‑first. Zero clutter.

## Single Intake + Two Views (Internal / Public)
**Single intake:** Everything starts as one **Agenda Intake** item (Action / Decision / Risk / Project / Note) captured in one place.

**Two views:**
- **Internal view:** Full context for decisions, handoffs, and compliance routing.
- **Public view (safe):** Shareable summary only (no internal notes, no sensitive details).

**In the OS UI:** Use the `Agenda` page to create items and toggle `Internal view` / `Public view (safe)`.

## Executive Summary (Logicville)
- One running workspace for decisions, priorities, and handoffs.
- Weekly sync (30–45 min) plus optional 90‑minute founders block.
- Every task uses **Owner • Due (YYYY‑MM‑DD) • DoD**.
- OML/PRR flagged where needed for compliance.
- Public artifacts are prepared with **WCAG 2.1 AA** in mind.

## Working Rules (Non‑Negotiables)
- Start/finish on time. Capture decisions before we leave.
- Keep language plain. Remove anything not actionable.
- Link to source systems; keep sensitive data out of this workspace.
- Every task has **Owner • Due • DoD** or it isn’t real.
- Mark **OML/PRR** when needed; VAULT™ handles routing/retention (high‑level only).

## Weekly Agenda Template (Founders)
**Today:** `YYYY-MM-DD`  
**Mode:** calm, clear, get‑it‑done

1. **Check‑in** — Where we’re actually at. Honest, quick, no extra polish.
2. **Day One** — Confirm lanes and priorities (no drift).
3. **VAULT Alignment** — High‑level map and compliance routing (PRR + service tickets).
4. **12‑Week Pilots** — Week 1–2 outputs: readiness docs + first SOP examples.
5. **PublicInsight** — Categories + scoring wording; remove noise.
6. **SOP + Continuity** — Universal template; fill two real examples; short + usable.
7. **Project Triage** — Pull what matters into the Agenda; ignore the rest.
8. **Next 10 Days** — Owners, dates, and DoD locked.
9. **Close** — What we locked, what rolls forward, reminders for tomorrow.

## Strategic Plan — 12‑Week Focus (Template)
**Vision**
- PublicLogic: frameworks towns can run.
- VAULT™: guardrails for routing/retention/audit (mechanics private).
- Outcome: staff safety • resident clarity • municipal control.

**Themes**
- Compliance everywhere (OML/PRR, retention, WCAG).
- Ship small → prove value → scale.
- Vendor‑friendly, town‑owned.
- Reduce staff anxiety: clear lanes + DoD.

**Timeline (fill dates)**
- Start: `YYYY-MM-DD`
- Weeks 1–4: readiness + docs — `YYYY-MM-DD`
- Weeks 5–8: live tests — `YYYY-MM-DD`
- Weeks 9–12: refinement + continuity — `YYYY-MM-DD`

## Compliance & Governance Checklist (MA)
- **Open Meeting Law (M.G.L. c.30A):** If a quorum/public body is implicated, ensure agendas, notices, minutes, and recordings follow statute and AG guidance.
- **Public Records (M.G.L. c.66 §10):** Structure outputs so they’re retrievable; apply retention tags.
- **Data Security (201 CMR 17.00):** Keep PII out of this workspace; link to secure systems; confirm access controls.
- **Accessibility:** Use plain language, headings, and alt text; check **WCAG 2.1 AA** for any public artifacts.
- **Retention:** Apply state schedule categories; route to ARCHIEVE™ enforcement where applicable (high‑level only).

## Definitions (Consistency)
- **DoD:** Definition of Done — objective criteria that proves completion.
- **OML:** Open Meeting Law.
- **PRR:** Public Records Request / public records readiness.
- **VAULT™ / ARCHIEVE™:** PublicLogic logic + enforcement layers (IP‑protected; described at high level only).
