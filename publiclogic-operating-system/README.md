# PublicLogic Operating System

This folder contains an operating system for running PublicLogic. It converts the mission and methods described on publiclogic.org into a repeatable, durable company cadence with clear offers, delivery playbooks, and metrics.

Start here:
- 01-mission-vision-values.md
- 02-icp-positioning.md
- 03-offers-pricing.md
- 04-delivery-playbooks.md
- 05-sales-marketing-cadence.md
- 06-ops-finance-cadence.md
- 07-metrics-dashboard.md
- 08-risks-assumptions.md
- 09-logicville-living-agenda.md
- 10-publicinstinct-framework.md

## Logicville Connection

Playbooks 09 and 10 connect the PublicLogic OS to Logicville, MA — the first municipal workspace running on this system.

- **09-logicville-living-agenda.md** — Living agenda template for weekly founder syncs, decision logs, action registers, and MA compliance checklists.
- **10-publicinstinct-framework.md** — The PublicInstinct™ behavioral layer: maps micro-situations to safer defaults and drills for frontline staff.

These playbooks are also available in the OS UI at `#/playbooks?doc=09-logicville-living-agenda.md` and via the **Logicville — Governance** card on the Tools page.

When PuddleJumper is deployed, the Tools card includes a link to the PuddleJumper Admin panel (configurable via `cfg.puddlejumper.adminUrl` in `config.js`).

How to use:
- Fill in the brackets and TODOs.
- Treat this as the "single source of truth" and update it each quarter.
- Keep changes lightweight; the system should reduce complexity, not add it.
