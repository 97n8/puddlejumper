# PublicLogic Operating System

This folder contains an operating system for running PublicLogic. It converts the mission and methods described on publiclogic.org into a repeatable, durable company cadence with clear offers, delivery playbooks, and metrics.

## Logicville Connection

Logicville, MA is the pilot municipality that runs on this operating system. The living agenda (09) defines the weekly cadence, registers (Action, Decision, Risk, Project), and compliance checklists used by the founders. It maps directly to the OS UI's Agenda page and is the working proof-of-concept for PublicLogic's municipal governance model.

The PublicInstinct Framework (10) defines the behavioral layer that shapes how staff make micro-decisions in real situations — the human operating layer on top of VAULT™.

Both playbooks are shared between this directory and the OS UI (`publiclogic-os-ui/content/playbooks/`). Keep them in sync.

How to use:
- Fill in the brackets and TODOs.
- Treat this as the "single source of truth" and update it each quarter.
- Keep changes lightweight; the system should reduce complexity, not add it.
