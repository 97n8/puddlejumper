# Risks and Assumptions

## Assumptions
- PublicLogic is focused on Massachusetts municipalities.
- Core value is compliance-ready workflows and continuity documentation, not software products.
- VAULT and ARCHIEVE are the core continuity and governance packages.
- Engagements are scoped and time-bounded with optional retainer follow-ups.

## Risks
- Misalignment on pricing or engagement scope.
- Over-customization reduces repeatability.
- Municipal budget cycles slow conversion.
- Capacity constraints during multi-town engagements.

## Open Questions
- Which services are highest margin today?
- Which municipal functions should be prioritized first?
- What is the current pricing strategy?
- What existing case studies can be anonymized?
- Preferred engagement length and cadence?

## Next Steps to Finalize
- Confirm offer names and scope
- Confirm pricing model
- Provide any existing materials to integrate
