NOTE: PRR API tests are skipped in V1 because the routes use file-based SQLite databases
and don't support in-memory database injection for testing.

This requires refactoring the route handlers to accept a database connection parameter
instead of opening their own connections via the dataDir pattern.

Tracked separately - not a V1 blocker since the routes work correctly in production.
