# Mission, Vision, Values

## Mission
Enable Massachusetts municipalities to meet public records, finance, and governance obligations through durable workflows, documented continuity, and compliant retention and access practices.

## Vision
A Commonwealth where every town can sustain compliant municipal operations across staff turnover and shifting political contexts, without relying on fragile software platforms or external takeovers.

## Value Proposition (One Sentence)
PublicLogic delivers compliance-ready municipal workflows and continuity systems so towns can meet statutory obligations and retain institutional knowledge.

## Core Values
1. Public trust first: Transparency, compliance, and stewardship of public records and funds.
2. Durability over novelty: Build processes that survive staff changes and budget cycles.
3. Enablement, not takeover: Work alongside municipal teams to transfer knowledge and capability.
4. Plain language: Simple documentation and pragmatic steps, not jargon.
5. Accountability: Clear commitments, measurable outcomes, and auditable documentation.

## Operating Principles
