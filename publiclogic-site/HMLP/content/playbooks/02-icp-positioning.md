# Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) and Positioning

## Primary ICP
- Massachusetts municipalities (towns/cities) seeking durable compliance and continuity in records, finance, and governance operations.
- Typical entry points: Town Clerk, Town Administrator/Manager, Finance Director, Select Board, and departmental leads.

## Secondary ICP
- Regional or shared-service bodies supporting multiple towns.
- Newly elected leadership teams seeking to professionalize operations quickly.

## Core Pain Points
- Compliance risk from undocumented or inconsistent workflows.
- Loss of institutional knowledge during staff transitions.
- Fragmented records retention and access practices.
- Difficulty translating statutory requirements into day-to-day practice.

## Primary Outcomes Sought
- Documented, compliant workflows and retention practices.
- Continuity packs that survive staffing changes.
- Clear roles, handoffs, and accountability.
- Trust and transparency with residents.

## Positioning
PublicLogic is a municipal governance practice that builds compliance-ready workflows and continuity systems. We are not a software vendor and we do not take over municipal functions. We work alongside teams to embed durable processes and transfer capability.
