# PublicInstinct™ Framework

## 1. Purpose
PublicInstinct is the behavioral layer of PublicLogic that focuses on what staff actually do in real situations, not only what the policy says they should do.

It is designed to:
- Turn legal and procedural requirements into default habits.
- Help staff make consistent, lawful, low‑stress choices under pressure.
- Reduce the gap between training, policy, and real‑world decisions.
- Capture and protect “good instincts” from your best employees so those instincts survive turnover.

PublicInstinct is not a separate product. It is the human operating layer that sits on top of VAULT™, PublicInsight™, and PublicPulse™ and shapes how people move inside those systems.

## 2. Position in the PublicLogic Stack
You can describe the behavioral stack this way:
- **VAULT™** keeps the work lawful, structured, and findable.
- **PublicInsight™** studies what is happening and why.
- **PublicPulse™** tracks how the organization feels and reacts.
- **PublicInstinct™** shapes the micro‑decisions people make in the moment.

PublicInstinct is the bridge between structure and reflex—where policy, data, and culture become muscle memory.

## 3. Core Principles
PublicInstinct runs on a few simple rules:

1) **Situations, not slogans**  
Start from specific, repeatable situations (resident upset at the counter, incomplete permit, after‑hours complaint, a board member emails staff directly).

2) **Default paths, not scripts**  
Staff don’t need a script. They need a clear default path that is safe, lawful, and humane—plus one backup path when something is off.

3) **Tiny decisions, large impact**  
Instinct lives in small choices (who you copy, where you click, what you write, when you say “I need to check that” instead of guessing).

4) **Practice under real conditions**  
Instinct is built in drills, low‑risk simulations, and walkthroughs that mirror actual pressure.

5) **No blame, high clarity**  
Blame‑free. Make the right move easier than the risky move.

## 4. The PublicInstinct Cycle
PublicInstinct runs as a repeating four‑stage cycle that can be applied to any function. Each stage can be done in one workshop or spread across a pilot.

### Stage 1. Map the Micro Situations
**Goal:** Define where instinct actually matters.

**Steps**
1. Pick a narrow workflow or role (Clerk intake, DPW requests, payroll, licensing, MS4 reporting, etc.).
2. With frontline staff, identify the situations that feel “touchy,” “tricky,” or “annoying.”
3. For each situation, capture:
   - What actually happens now.
   - What staff wish they could do.
   - What the law or policy expects.
   - What the system (CivicPlus, Polimorphic, Microsoft 365, etc.) technically allows.

**Deliverable:** PublicInstinct Situation Map (table of situations, current instinct, desired instinct, constraints).

### Stage 2. Design Safer Defaults
**Goal:** Create clear default patterns that are safer and easier than current habits.

For each situation, design:
1. **Default Action** — The move that should happen in 9 out of 10 cases.
2. **Backup Action** — What to do when the default doesn’t fit.
3. **One Rule of Thumb** — A sentence staff can remember.
4. **System Touchpoints** — Fields/lists/routing in VAULT™ or the local platform that reinforce the instinct.

**Deliverable:** Instinct Playcard (one page per situation).

### Stage 3. Drill and Anchor
**Goal:** Move from “we agreed” to “we can do this without thinking.”

Methods:
1. **Tabletop runs** — Walk through scenarios; narrate what you would click/say.
2. **Micro drills in live systems** — Short repetition sessions in the actual form/workflow.
3. **Cue setting** — Reminders in forms, SOPs, and checklists that mirror playcards.
4. **Personal anchor** — Each staff member writes one sentence about why the instinct protects them.

**Deliverable:** PublicInstinct Drill Pack (scenarios, scripts, screenshots).

### Stage 4. Review, Drift Check, and Refresh
**Goal:** Prevent drift as tools, staff, and laws change.

Methods:
1. **Drift review** — Sample records/tickets and look for “instinct drift.”
2. **Story collection** — Short stories where the instinct helped or was hard to follow.
3. **Adjust and retrain** — Update the system or run a quick refresher drill.
4. **Feed back into Insight/Pulse** — Drift becomes insight; feedback becomes pulse.

**Deliverable:** Drift Log + refresh cadence.

## 5. Artifacts and Tools
PublicInstinct uses simple, repeatable artifacts:
- Situation Map
- Instinct Playcards
- Drill Pack
- Drift Log

These are vendor‑agnostic and can sit inside any storage platform beside VAULT™ schemas and SOPs.

## 6. Implementation Cadence
PublicInstinct can run as a 12‑week pilot or a lighter 6‑week cycle.

**12‑week pattern**
- Weeks 1–2: Pick workflow; build Situation Map.
- Weeks 3–5: Design Playcards.
- Weeks 6–8: Drill and anchor (live practice).
- Weeks 9–12: Drift review, stories, adjustments, refresh plan.

PublicInstinct is cyclical: revisit functions once or twice a year—especially after turnover, new laws, or new platforms.

## 7. Roles (Municipal)
- **Sponsor:** Town Administrator/Manager or department head who sets priority and clears space.
- **Behavioral Lead:** PublicLogic partner or internal champion.
- **Process Owner:** Department leader who owns the workflow.
- **System Owner:** Person who can change fields/lists/routing in the platform.
- **Frontline Staff:** The people who actually live the instinct daily.

## 8. Example Use Cases
The cycle applies to:
- Clerk intake and records requests.
- DPW/service tickets and turnaround expectations.
- MS4 reporting checklists.
- Payroll/timesheet approvals.
- Licensing/renewal handling.
- High‑pressure performance environments where instinct is about safety and pacing.

## 9. How PublicInstinct Protects People
PublicInstinct is about protection:
- Protects residents from arbitrary treatment.
- Protects staff from being blamed when the system was unclear.
- Protects leadership by proving expectations were clear and practiced, not written once and forgotten.

Combined with VAULT™, PublicInsight™, and PublicPulse™, it creates a closed loop: what should happen, what does happen, how people feel, and how the organization updates the habits that carry the work.
